# Cloud School Management System

## Overview
This project is a fully functional cloud-based school management system developed using Python, Django, and SQLite. It provides separate panels for administrators, teachers, and students, each equipped with specific modules tailored to their roles.

The administrator panel includes modules for managing students, staff, courses, subjects, sessions, notifications, leaves, feedback, attendance, and logout.

The student panel provides access to modules such as the dashboard, attendance tracking, result viewing, leave requests, feedback submission, notifications, and logout.

Similarly, the staff panel offers functionalities like the dashboard for overview, attendance management, result handling, leave management, feedback submission, notifications, and logout.

I am looking to add this project to GitHub to showcase my work and collaborate with others. Your guidance in setting this up would be greatly appreciated.
